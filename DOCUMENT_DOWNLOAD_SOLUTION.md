## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Admin Panel - Supporting Documents Section:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Supporting Documents                            │
│                                                  │
│  📄 Report.pdf                                   │
│     [Download]  [Alt Download]                   │
│                                                  │
│  📄 ID-Proof.jpg                                 │
│     [Download]                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Two Options:

1. **Download Button** (Primary)
   - Downloads using the URL stored in database
   - Works for most documents

2. **Alt Download Button** (Backup - only for PDFs)
   - Downloads using alternate URL format
   - Use if first button doesn't work

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Changed:

**Before (Didn't Work):**
- Tried to open PDF in browser
- Browser PDF viewer required specific URL format
- Failed with 404 error

**After (Works Now):**
- Forces download instead of view
- Uses Cloudinary's `fl_attachment` flag
- Downloads regardless of resource type
- Works with old and new uploads

### The Magic Flag:

```
Original URL:
https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/image/upload/v123/file.pdf

Download URL (Auto-generated):
https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/image/upload/fl_attachment/v123/file.pdf
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                         Forces download!
```
