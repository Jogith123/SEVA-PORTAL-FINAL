# Quick Guide: Viewing Documents in Admin Panel

## 🎯 If You Get 404 Error

When clicking "View" shows "This page can't be found":

### ✅ Solution: Click the "Alt" Button

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📄 Report.pdf                                  │
│                                                 │
│  [View]  [Alt]  ← Click "Alt" if "View" fails  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What it does:**
- "View" = Original URL from database
- "Alt" = Alternate URL format
- One of them will work!

## 🎨 Button Guide

### Regular Documents (After Fix):
```
📄 filename.pdf    [View]
```
- Only "View" button
- Works immediately

### Old Documents (Before Fix):
```
📄 filename.pdf    [View] [Alt]
```
- Both buttons available
- Try "View" first, then "Alt"

---

## 💡 Why Does This Happen?

**Old uploads** (before fix):
- Stored in Cloudinary with wrong format
- Database has one URL
- File exists at different URL

**New uploads** (after fix):
- Stored correctly
- Only "View" button needed
- Works immediately

## 🔧 For Developers

### Manually Construct URLs:

If you need to access Cloudinary directly:

**For PDFs:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/[cloud]/raw/upload/[path]/file.pdf
                                    ^^^
                                  Use "raw"
```

**For Images:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/[cloud]/image/upload/[path]/file.jpg
                                    ^^^^^
                                  Use "image"
```

### Edit Documents Manually:

If you want to update specific URLs in the database:

1. **Find the change request** in `change_requests` table
2. **Check `supportingDocuments` column**
3. **Replace** `/image/upload/` with `/raw/upload/` for PDFs
4. **Save** the change

## 📊 Quick Reference

| Document Type | Correct URL Format | Button Behavior |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| New PDF | `/raw/upload/` | View only ✅ |
| Old PDF | `/image/upload/` | View + Alt 🔄 |
| New Image | `/image/upload/` | View only ✅ |
| Old Image | `/image/upload/` | View only ✅ |

---

## ⚠️ If Nothing Works

If both "View" and "Alt" show 404:

1. **File may not exist** in Cloudinary
2. **Upload may have failed** originally
3. **Solution**: Ask user to re-submit the request

**How to request re-submission:**
1. Reject the request
2. Add comment: "Please re-submit with new supporting documents"
3. User submits again
4. New upload will work correctly

---

## ✅ Summary

**Most Common Issue**: Old PDF with wrong URL format  
**Quick Fix**: Click "Alt" button
